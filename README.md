# CLIP for Image Style Transfer Exploring Text Image Correlations
The primary objective of this thesis is to explore the potential of CLIP for image style
transfer with a particular focus on leveraging text-image correlations. The specific research
questions that this work aims to address are:

1. ## Can CLIP be effectively used for image style transfer? This involves the development
and evaluation of a method that uses CLIP to transfer the style of a text
description to an image. The performance of this method will be evaluated based
on the quality of the style transfer and the preservation of the original content.

2. ## How can text-image correlations be leveraged to improve image style transfer?
This is proposed to fully analyze the ability of CLIP for general image style transfer.
This will be applied to find the linear or sub-linear correlations between texts and
images to demonstrate that CLIP can generally map arbitrary patterns to the target
images.

3. ## Extensive experiments and analysis on text-driven style transfer. This will be
done to conduct experiments on several datasets to apply our text-driven style transfer
and analyze its subjective and objective quality.
